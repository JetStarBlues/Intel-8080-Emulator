### Description:

Emulates the [Intel 8080][1] instruction set.


### Usage:

To use, run `main.py`. In the file, you can specify which 8080 program you want to run. The default is Tiny Basic.


### Extra features:

Typing can be tedious. See `main.py` for an idea of how to use the autotype feature.

Debugging can be a pain. See `main_dev.py` for an idea of how to use the breakpoint and stepping features.


### About Tiny Basic:

It turns out there are many versions of Tiny Basic. The version included is Roger Rauskolb's translation of Dr. Wang's Tiny Basic (see the PDF). A cheatsheet has been provided for quick reference.
